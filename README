sort script for your canon dslr image and movie files

If you copy the content of your canon dslr sd/memory card, you get all files (jpg, raw, mov) in one folder. 
If you use xee or any other image viewer, browsing through this folder isn't very nice. It would be very nice, if every filetype is located in an own folder.

This little shell script parses the actual folder, create subfolders for your movies and raw images and move the files into the right folders.
